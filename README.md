# GO Project Euler

[Project Euler Website](https://projecteuler.net/)

This is a casual project which tries to implement some of the Project Euler problems. They are meant to be educative in terms to teach Go and mathematical/computer problems.

## Project Structure

In general the individual problem solution would be in the directory named `problem{id}` where `id` would correspond to the problem id [here](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Each problem directory should have minimum two files:
    - problem{id}.go : File to host the program logic of the solution.
    - problem{id}_test.go : File to host the testcases for the suggested solution.

## Contributing

Anyone who is interested in implementing the Go versions of the Project Euler problems can feel free to contribute. One can add tests or alternative solutions for the problems.
