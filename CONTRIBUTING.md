# CONTRIBUTING

The repository is to host solutions to the Project Euler problems in [Go](https://go.dev/). The repository aims to hold generic solutions to the Project Euler problems. This repository is open to any good proposed solution to a problem.

The agenda of this repository is to make contributors learn Go while solving the problems and while going through the code. A contributor only needs to know basic math and Go to go through this repository code.

One can use any available IDE or text editor(preferably [vscode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) as it has some good extensions and support for Go) to review the code and contribute to it. The local machine should have a version of [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed(preferably the latest stable version).
